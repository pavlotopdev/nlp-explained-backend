    Now in 2011 marked a significant milestone in the evolution of NLP 
    technology. These assistants use speech recognition, natural language

    provide relevant responses. The technology behind them has improved 
    over time, enabling them to perform more complex tasks, such as 
    booking a cab or ordering food."""

    improve customer satisfaction and reduce response times."""
