p2 = """At its core, sentiment analysis is a process that uses 
    natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify text data 
    as positive, negative, or neutral. The process involves several 
    steps, including data preparation, feature extraction, and 
    classification."""

p3 = """Data preparation involves cleaning and preprocessing the 
    text data to remove noise and irrelevant information. This can 
    include removing stop words, stemming or lemmatizing words, and 
    handling special characters and punctuation."""

p4 = """Feature extraction involves transforming the text data 
    into a numerical representation that can be used for machine 
    learning. This can include techniques such as bag of words, 
    TF-IDF, or word embeddings."""

    algorithms to classify the text data. This can include algorithms 
    such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, or support vector 
    machines."""
