    intelligence that deals with processing and understanding human 
    language. With NLP, you can build applications that can analyze,

    lot of programming skills, especially in Python. You'll need to 
    know how to work with data structures, manipulate strings, and 
    perform statistical analysis."""

    libraries out there, such as spaCy, NLTK, and TextBlob. Each has 
    its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's worth experimenting with 
    a few to find the one that works best for you."""

    right away. Instead, start with a simple project, such as a 
    sentiment analysis tool or a chatbot that can answer basic 
    questions. This will help you get a feel for the tools and 
    techniques involved in NLP."""
