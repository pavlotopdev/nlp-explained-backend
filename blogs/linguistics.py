p2 = """At the core of NLP lies linguistics - the scientific study 
    of language and its structure. Linguistics helps NLP systems 
    understand how words and phrases relate to each other in a sentence, 
    the meaning of words in context, and the rules governing the 
    structure of sentences. Linguistic knowledge is essential for 
    developing NLP models that can accurately interpret and generate 
    natural language."""

p3 = """However, understanding language is just the beginning. ML 
    algorithms are used to analyze and process large amounts of language 
    data, enabling NLP models to learn and improve over time. By training 
    NLP models on vast amounts of text data, they can identify patterns, 
    make predictions, and generate natural language responses."""

p4 = """One of the key challenges in NLP is dealing with the nuances 
    of human language. For example, the same word can have different 
    meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Similarly, 
    different languages and dialects have their own unique grammatical 
    structures and nuances, making it challenging to create NLP models 
    that can accurately interpret and generate natural language across 
    different languages."""

p5 = """Despite these challenges, NLP has made significant progress 
    in recent years, thanks to advancements in linguistics and machine 
    learning. Today, NLP is being used in a wide range of applications, 
    from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to language translation 
    and sentiment analysis in social media."""

    linguistics and machine learning. By combining these fields,
